                <p>Without knowing it at the time, my UX journey started in 2018. My partner and I were living in a 350 sq./ft. casita that came with 
                    many spacial compromises. Finding mass market solutions that fit into the space, matched our aesthetic and satisfied functional
                    requirements was nearly impossible. As a result, I found myself making custom furniture that met our needs.
                </p>
                <p>Designing and building furniture for our home eventually led to taking commission work for other people’s homes. The user experience 
                    of my projects was always a central focus of my designs - I was often building furniture around dimensional and functional demands. 
                    I learned how to prioritize integration into existing spaces and the subtleties of sensational feedback.
                </p>
                <p>My background is very diverse and non-traditional, which lends to a broadened perspective and empathy for the users I design for. 
                    Helping others re-envision what’s in front of them is incredibly satisfying to me in respect to both digital and physical spaces. 
                    I enrolled in the University of Arizona’s UX/UI Bootcamp in March 2022 and am set to complete the course in September. My mission 
                    is to leverage my unique blend of skillsets to bring familiarity and usability into users’ experiences.
